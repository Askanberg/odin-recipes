The odin project - Recipes (First Project)

This is the first project of the web-development tutorial called The Odin Project.
Up until this point I have learned:
*Basic linux cli-commands
*Git and github basics
*Html basics
    Which include:
    *Setting up a html file (body, head, lang etc)
    *Writing text to a page (Header, paragraphs)
    *Manipulating text on a page (Bold, Italic, Strong etc)
    *Implementing unordered and ordered lists
    *Adding links to the webpage (Absolute and relative links)
    *Adding images to the webpage
